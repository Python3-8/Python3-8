# Me
Hi, I'm Pranav. I'm 14 yo, and I play chess and write code. I used to be into speedcubing but I'm not anymore.
I wrote my first line of code in 2019 when I started learning Python, and fell in love with it. I'm completely self-taught,
and most of my projects are just random, useless but interesting ideas that I come up with.

I'm _@prawnydagrate_ on most platforms including YouTube, Discord, Chess.com, and Lichess,
and [_@puissant.patzer_](https://instagram.com/puissant.patzer) on Instagram.
